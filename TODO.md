To-Do List
==========

* wrap a little gui around this so non-devs can play
* add cool 'kill' effect (explosion, other)
* the drawing can be made faster by using 'copy'
* rename some of the classes and files to represent what this code became
  (it didn't start off to be a 'kill the characters' game ... that just kinda happened)
